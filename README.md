# Truffle React Dapp with Ganache

## Overview

This repository contains a simple decentralized application (Dapp) built using Truffle, React, and Ganache. The Dapp interacts with a local Ethereum blockchain provided by Ganache.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Truffle: `npm install -g truffle`
- Ganache: [Download Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- MetaMask or any other Ethereum wallet extension for your browser

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/truffle-react-ganache-dapp.git
   cd truffle-react-ganache-dapp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Ganache and create a new workspace, connecting to the local Ethereum blockchain.**

4. **Compile and migrate the smart contracts:**

   ```bash
   truffle compile
   truffle migrate
   ```

5. **Run the React app:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should open in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/`. Make sure MetaMask or your preferred wallet is connected to the local Ganache blockchain.
